# TheaterManagement
Program to manage seating in a theater. This was a project, final project for Intro to Programming, that I attempted to do in my freshman year but I could not program properly. 
The program keeps track of a theater that has 15 rows and 30 seats in each row, 450 capacity. It is able to display the theater seating chart and update with each purchase, 
shows sales, make sales, keeping track of sales by row.
